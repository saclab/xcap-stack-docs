# XCAP Introduction

$$
\Rho(x,y,x) = \frac{1}{V} \sum_{-h}^h\sum_{-k}^k\sum_{-l}^l F_{hkl} .\exp[-2\pi i(hx + ky + lz - \alpha_{hkl})]
$$
*Almost all aspects of life are engineered at the molecular level, and without understanding molecules we can only have a sketchy understanding of life itself. - *Francis Crick**

**X**ray **C**rystallography and **A**nalytics **P**ipeline, **XCAP** is a project to reimagine the crystallography tools in a modern, state of the art computer world. We are a group of software developers working continuously with crystallographers, biochemists and research scientists to architect, write and build an automation pipeline taking advantage of modern concepts like containerization, microservices, graph APIs with the philosophy of DevSecOps in the core.

On the first phase, the primary objective of the project is to collect, link and bridge different crystallography tools that are available under a single framework to provide easier usability by developing intuitive user interfaces and CLI tools, better security by implementing industry-standard protocols, scalability by opening up standard APIs, enabling every stakeholder in the crystallography and drug discovery world to focus on what they do best.

# High-level Technical Overview

The core idea of the project revolves around modularity. 
### Interfaces
```mermaid

PhaseDetermination>Interface : Phase Determination]
style PhaseDetermination fill:#ff984f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:0px
PDInp1[Input Reflection file]
PDISearchModel[Search Model]
PDIModelIdentity[Model Identity]
PDIOutputFile[Output File]
PDInp1 --> PhaseDetermination
PDISearchModel --> PhaseDetermination
PDIModelIdentity --> PhaseDetermination
PhaseDetermination --> PDIOutputFile

Next>Interface : Next Interface]
PDIOutputFile -.-> Next

```
The pipeline declares '**interfaces**' (or stages) in a workflow. In general, an [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_%28computing%29) is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. The interfaces specify a set of protocols that needs to be followed for the exchange to happen. 
An *example* will be a "Music Player".  For anything to be called as a music player, it at least should have a play, pause, stop control and an output jack for an aux device. This set of the specification is given by the music player interface. The interface does not look further on how things are implemented beneath it. Another example in the crystallography world is the 'Phase Determination` Interface. The interfaces specify that it requires an input reflection file, a search model, model identity to construct an electron density model as output. 
### Modules
```mermaid
graph TB   
  subgraph Interface
	PhaseDetermination>Interface : Phase Determination]
	pp[Phaser]
	style pp fill:#4dc6ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:0px
	sx[Shellx]
	style sx fill:#4dc6ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:0px
	ot[Another Module]
	style ot fill:#4dc6ff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:1px, stroke-dasharray: 5, 5
	pp --- PhaseDetermination
	sx --- PhaseDetermination
	ot -.- PhaseDetermination
  end

```

The interface is implemented in **modules**.  The modules are where the heavy work is done and the logic is built. An mp3 player, a cassette player, a boombox, an iPod, all are modules to the interface Music  Player.
Similarly, Phenix.phaser that does molecular replacement and ccp4.SHELX can be example modules for the phase determination interface.
An interface can have multiple modules. In other words, various modules that obey that specific interface can be plugged in.

### Dataflow
The xcap.core bridges interfaces as specified to form a workflow. Bridged interfaces should be compatible with each other.
```mermaid
graph LR
DataCollection>Diffraction Data Collection]

DataCollection --> PhaseDetermination
PhaseDetermination --> ElectronDensityInter
ElectronDensityInter --> ModelBuilding
ModelBuilding --> Refine
```
